# drip_experiment
Trying to model lithospheric drips with the ASPECT mantle convection code 

Run these parameter files with aspect, they are written for aspect 2.2.0.

The 2ddrip.prm file is ran with aspect and is edited constantly since each simulation has the original prm file attached to the output folder. If we wanted to revert to previous parameters we can simply copy that code.
